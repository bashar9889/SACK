# Smart Alarm Clock Kit (SACK) Capstone Project

# Project
**IDE Installation guides are provided in the docs folder**

## Data Capture Watch
The Data Capture Watch (or just Watch) is a wearable sensor that takes the users Heart rate and Movement Data. The data collected from the user is sent 
to the Clock through BLE.

To program the watch, the Simplicity Studio IDE will be used. 


## Smart Alarm Clock
The Smart Alarm Clock (or just Clock) is a clock module that takes takes in data from the watch. The data is used configure to measure the users sleep patterns and configure the alarm. The Alarm can be programmed directly, but the alarm may sound earlier if the user is at REM right before the alarm goes off.

To program the Clock, the ESP-IDF extension in VS Code will be used.


## S.A.C.K App
The S.A.C.K App (or just App) is a wearable sensor that takes the users Heart rate and Movement Data. The data collected from the user is sent 
to the Clock through BLE.

To program the App, the Flutter IDE will be used.
